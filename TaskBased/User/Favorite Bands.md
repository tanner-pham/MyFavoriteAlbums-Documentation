## Get Started

Before using this tab, confirm:

## How to Use Favorite Artists

1. Open **Favorite Artists**.
2. Choose the minimum number of albums required for an artist to be included.
3. Choose whether to exclude EPs and Live albums.
4. Click **Submit**.
5. Review the resulting table and compare which artists rise to the top.

## What the Results Show

The table includes:

- Artist
- Rating (average)
- NumAlbums (count used for the result)

Results are intended to prioritize stronger average ratings while respecting your minimum-album and EP/Live settings.
If your filters are strict, the list can be short.

## Troubleshooting

`I changed filters but results did not change`
- Click **Submit** to apply your new selections.

`I see very few artists`
- Lower the minimum album threshold.
- Re-check whether EP/Live exclusion is enabled.

`Results look different from last session`
- Verify filter settings first.
- Confirm whether the data file was edited between runs.
