# Artist Comparison
*(Updated February 19, 2026)*

This guide explains how to use the **Artist Comparison** tab to compare two artists visually.

> **Note**: This tab updates automatically as you change artist selections. A **Submit** button is not required.

## Get Started
Before using this tab, confirm:

- The app is running.
- You can open **Artist Comparison** from the top tab row.
- You can see both artist selectors and the chart area.
- The graph renders under both dropdowns.

## How to Use Artist Comparison

1. Open **Artist Comparison**.
2. Choose the first artist.
3. Choose the second artist.
4. Review the updated chart.

## What the Chart Shows

The chart should show each selected artist’s ratings over time as you update the artist dropdowns:

- One artist is shown in red.
- The other artist is shown in blue.
- Points represent rated entries by year.
- The vertical scale shows rating values.

> **Note**: Unlike other components, you **do not** need to click **Submit** for initial or later updates.

## Expected Edge Cases

- If both selectors use the same artist, lines can overlap. This can make it look like the app is not rendering the second graph.

## Troubleshooting

`I changed an artist but cannot tell what changed`
- Select two clearly different artists for easier visual contrast.

`The chart is hard to read`
- Use artists with fewer entries first.
- Re-select artists to reset and compare again.

`The chart feels cluttered`
- This can happen with artists who have many entries across many years.
- Try another pair to simplify the view.
