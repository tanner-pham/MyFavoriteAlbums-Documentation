# Vinyl
*(Updated February 19, 2026)*

This guide explains how to use the **Vinyl** tab to find high-rated albums that are not currently marked as owned on vinyl.

> **Note**: This tab requires clicking **Submit** to refresh results.

> **Note**: If no rows match your selected threshold, an empty table will appear. 

## Get Started

Before using this tab, confirm:

- The app is running.
- You can open **Vinyl** from the top tab row.
- You can see the rating-threshold selector and **Submit** button.

## How to Use Vinyl

1. Open **Vinyl**.
2. Choose a rating threshold option.
3. Click **Submit**.
4. Review matching albums in the table and use that list as your follow-up queue.

## What the Results Show

The results table includes:

- Album
- Artist
- Rating

This table is intended to highlight stronger-rated entries that are not marked as owned on vinyl in your data.

As you raise the rating threshold, the list typically becomes smaller due to being more selective.

## Expected Behavior

- Changing the threshold does not apply until **Submit** is clicked.
- If your data marks many albums as owned on vinyl, results may be short or empty.

## Troubleshooting

`The table is empty`
- Try a lower threshold.
- Confirm your data includes entries not marked as owned on vinyl.

`I changed the threshold and nothing happened`
- Click **Submit** to refresh the table.

`Results are not what I expected`
- Verify the data file’s vinyl markers were entered consistently.
- Restart the app after data edits.
