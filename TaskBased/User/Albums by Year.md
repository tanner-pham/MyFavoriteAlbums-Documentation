## Expected Edge Cases

- If the selected year has no data, the table can appear empty.
- If your source data has duplicate rankings for a year, both rows may appear.

## Troubleshooting

`I selected a year but no results changed`
- Click **Submit**.

`The year I need is not in the dropdown`
- Confirm that year exists in `album-rankings.csv`.
- Restart the app after data edits.

`The table is empty`
- Try another year to confirm data is available.
- Verify your data file changes were saved correctly.
