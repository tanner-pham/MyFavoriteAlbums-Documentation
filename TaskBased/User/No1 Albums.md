# Number One Albums
*(Updated February 19, 2026)*

This guide explains how to use the **Number One Albums** tab to view top-ranked albums across a selected year range.

> **Note**: This tab updates as you move the year-range slider. A separate **Submit** button is not required here.

## Get Started

Before using this tab, confirm:

- The app is running.
- You can open the **Number One Albums** tab from the top navigation row.
- The year-range slider is visible.

## How to Use Number One Albums

1. Open **Number One Albums**.
2. Drag the left slider handle to set the start year.
3. Drag the right slider handle to set the end year.
4. Review the table results for the selected range.

## What the Results Show

The table shows one row per matching year, with:

- Year
- Album
- Artist

The selected range is inclusive, which means both boundary years are included when matching data exists.
This view is useful when you want a quick “best of each year” scan without opening each year individually.

## Expected Behavior

- Results refresh immediately when the slider changes.
- If a year has no matching top-ranked entry in your data, that year will not appear.

## Troubleshooting

`The table looks empty`
- Expand the year range.
- Confirm your data includes ranked entries for the chosen years.

`A specific year is missing`
- Check whether that year has a top-ranked album in your data.
- Verify your CSV changes were saved correctly, then restart the app.
